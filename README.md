# time-table-extractor
This would generate time table for asked faculty from a master time table
What this script do?
-> It takes Faculty code as input and prepare it's time-table from master time table which is much easier to read
What are algorithms used and how they decrease time complexity?
-> It uses Rabin Karp algorithm for string matching and reduces required time complexity to O(N+M) from O(N.M)
