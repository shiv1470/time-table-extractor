# time-table-extractor
This would generate time table for asked faculty from a master time table

1. What this script do?

-> It takes Faculty code as input and prepare it's time-table from master time table which is much easier to read

2. What are algorithms used and how they decrease time complexity?

-> It uses Rabin Karp algorithm for string matching and reduces required time complexity to O(N+M) from O(N.M)

3. What are the modules it uses?

-> It uses XLRD module of python3 which enable users to read excel file in structured manner.
